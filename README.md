# Fifa 2022 World Cup tickets website
Building backend services to handle ticket sales for the Fifa 2022 World Cup in
Qatar. Given the huge demand on tickets, it has been decided by the Fifa governance committee that ticket
sales can be purchased through several approved websites instead of having one single website to handle
all the sales.There is a master list of games which consists of all the games and total
occupancy allowed, amongst other useful information. For example, if website #1 makes a reservation, that
change should be reflected in teams 2..N. Each team can have up to 5 individuals.
